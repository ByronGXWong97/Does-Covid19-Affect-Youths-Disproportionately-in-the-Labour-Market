The International Labour Organization claims that the pandemic has a \"devastating and disproportionate\" impact on youth unemployment. \n\nMany worry about a \"lockdown generation\" or \"lost generation\", as the current crisis might blight their long-term employment and earnings prospect. The Centre for Economic Policy Research found that one month of unemployment at age 18-20 is associated with a lifetime income loss of 2% as unemployed youths miss out on gaining skills and experience necessary to climb the career ladder.\n\nIn this project, I ***investigate if youths are disproportionately affected by the Covid-19 pandemic in the job market.*** This project uses unemployment data by sex and age for the European Union (obtained from the EU Open Data Portal). I also used an ISO dataset to map the ISO country codes to the country names. I will compare the average youth unemployment rate before and after March 2020. I then use ***difference-in-differences*** to isolate the differential impact of the pandemic on youth unemployment in Europe. This approach is sound insofar as there are no other factors that might cause unemployment rate to change at differing rates for youths and adults.\n\nIf you find this notebook helpful, please give it an upvote!

This implies that ***there is no evidence to suggest that youths in Europe are disproportionately affected by the ongoing global pandemic***, at least based on data from the select group of countries and time-period. It might be useful to continue monitoring the numbers for the months to come to arrive at a more conclusive result.\n\nRegardless, this project reinforces the severity of youth unemployment in Europe. The EU announced the Youth Employment Support package in July 2020, which will comprise of improved vocational education, training, apprenticeships and guidance. This package is a step in the right direction, and will hopefully mitigate pressures on youth unemployment."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Acknowledgements\nhttps://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/society/20200709STO83004/covid-19-how-the-eu-fights-youth-unemployment\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-unemployment-youth-idUSKBN24A0LN\n\n"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"name":"ir","display_name":"R","language":"R"},"language_info":{"name":"R","codemirror_mode":"r","pygments_lexer":"r","mimetype":"text/x-r-source","file_extension":".r","version":"3.6.3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
